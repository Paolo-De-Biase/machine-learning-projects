# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and supporting files for my ongoing machine learning journey. The work here combines structured learning with hands-on experimentation, applying concepts to real-world data and gradually building towards advanced, production-ready models.

## Project Roadmap

### **Phase 1 – Foundations**
Goal: Build a strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals through structured learning and guided projects.  
- Implement exercises from *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*  
- Potentially expand into additional books, courses, and exercise sets to reinforce concepts and gain multiple perspectives  
- Cover core concepts: data preprocessing, supervised & unsupervised learning, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning  
- Apply tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow  
- Maintain clean, documented notebooks for future reference

### **Phase 2 – Applied Machine Learning**
Goal: Transition from foundational work to self-directed, goal-oriented projects.  
- Design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines for specific use cases  
- Experiment with time series, finance, and quantitative modelling applications  
- Incorporate best practices for reproducibility and scalability  
- Begin integrating live or frequently updating data sources (e.g., market/forex feeds)  
- Evaluate performance with appropriate metrics and improve model deployment readiness

## Repository Structure
- `Hands-On Machine Learning.ipynb` – Main notebook for Phase 1 exercises and experiments
- `.gitignore` – Excludes unnecessary files such as Jupyter checkpoints and cache

## Requirements
To recreate the environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
or manually install:
```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```
